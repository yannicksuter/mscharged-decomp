> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository does **not** provide a new way to play *Mario Strikers Charged*. It is not a modern recompilation ("recomp") or a port. Its 100% code and linking status refers to a high-fidelity reconstruction of what the original source code may have looked like—one that compiles into an executable byte-for-byte identical to the original retail Nintendo Wii release.
>
> Recompilations and ports may emerge elsewhere from this work—and we look forward to seeing them—but they are outside the scope of this repository. Please do not ask for recompilations or ports in the decompilation Discord, as producing and supporting them is not the focus of this community.

A work-in-progress matching decompilation of *Mario Strikers Charged* for
Nintendo Wii, developed by Next Level Games and published by Nintendo.

> [!NOTE]
> A [native PC port](https://github.com/yannicksuter/mscharged-port) is currently in development based on this work-in-progress decompilation. The port uses the decompiled source directly and does not rely on recompilation ("recomp"). This approach will enable bug fixes and make the game moddable.

This repository does **not** contain game assets or assembly. You must provide
your own legally obtained copy of the game.

## Supported versions

| Version | Region and title | Revision | Status | `main.dol` SHA-1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `R4QE01` | USA - *Mario Strikers Charged* | Rev 1 | **Complete: 100% code and linking** | `e96d2298067b70652752145b4e63644e6e1b1560` |
| `R4QP01` | Europe - *Mario Strikers Charged Football* | Rev 2 | **In progress** | `c39e1eda1942aa2fc96a6a71bfef051698e23516` |

`R4QE01` remains the default. Its build links entirely from reconstructed
source. The EU build reuses matching source units from USA; regional differences
and unresolved ranges still use extracted objects. Both builds reproduce their
original DOL.

Decompilation
=============

Decompilation is the process of reverse-engineering compiled machine code back into human-readable source code. Unlike disassembly, which produces assembly language, decompilation aims to reconstruct high-level code (like C or C++) that closely matches what the original developers wrote. This process involves analyzing the binary executable, understanding its structure and behavior, and translating it back into source code that compiles to produce identical machine code. In this project, the goal is not just a close match, but a **100% match**—the decompiled source code must compile to produce byte-for-byte identical machine code to the original. This is why diffing (see the [Diffing](#diffing) section below) is an essential piece of the process, as it allows us to verify that our decompiled code produces exactly the same binary output as the original game. Decompilation projects like this one enable deeper understanding of game mechanics, facilitate modding and preservation, and serve as valuable learning resources for understanding how games were built.

> [!NOTE]
> **On the use of AI.** *Mario Strikers Charged* shipped without any debug information. After finishing the [*Super Mario Strikers* decompilation](https://github.com/yannicksuter/smstrikers-decomp), I was fairly certain that a large part of its code had been carried over into the sequel. AI was used mainly to correlate this game's translation units with likely donor classes from the predecessor, and to review the matches found this way. This gave the project a substantial head start and allowed it to progress quickly.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Ninja

The build downloads pinned versions of decomp-toolkit, the compiler, binutils,
objdiff-cli, and wibo when needed.

## Building

Place a supported disc image in `orig/<version>` (`orig/R4QE01` for USA or
`orig/R4QP01` for Europe). ISO, RVZ, WIA, WBFS, CISO, NFS, GCZ, and TGC images
are supported. Use the disc revision listed above.

Then configure and build:

```sh
python3 configure.py
ninja
```

To select the EU version:

```sh
python3 configure.py --version R4QP01
ninja
```

Running `python3 configure.py` without `--version` selects USA again. Build
outputs are kept separately in `build/<version>`; `build.ninja` and
`objdiff.json` describe the currently selected version.

On the first build, decomp-toolkit extracts `sys/main.dol` from the disc image
and performs the initial analysis. Once extraction succeeds, the disc image can
be removed from `orig/<version>` to save space.

The generated `config/R4QE01/symbols.txt` and `config/R4QE01/splits.txt` are
checked into the repository. A successful build ends with:

```text
build/R4QE01/main.dol: OK
```

To generate a linker map for the reconstructed ELF, configure with `--map`:

```sh
python3 configure.py --map
ninja
```

The result is written to `build/<version>/main.elf.MAP`. It describes the
reconstructed link rather than an original development map and is intentionally
ignored by Git.

## Diffing

After configuration, open the project directory in
[objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff). It reads the generated
`objdiff.json` automatically and rebuilds changed objects with Ninja.

Some retained template definitions are provided by another compiled source
object. `objdiff_weak_providers` lists those sources for a unit. Ninja creates
its comparison object in `build/<version>/compare/`, preserving the local
object's definitions and adding missing weak definitions from the providers.
The ordinary compiled objects remain the linker inputs. This accounts for
shared method matches; source-linking a TU still requires matching its layout.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before
starting work so that changes follow the repository's matching, style, and
asset-handling rules.
